    * when learning any programming language immediate feedback is important and with traditional java programmming this was missing since the beginning of java
    *
    * so with java 9, JShell was introduced to fill this gap. JShell is an interactive tool for learning java nad prototyping java code
    *
    * JShell which is a Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop (REPL) can help flatten out the learning curve of java
    *
    * it evaluates declarations, statements, and expressions as they are entered and immediately shows the results
    *
    * the tool is run from the command line
    *
    * Java has a step learning curve, as you know just to print out the "hello world" you have to type in 5 line of code.
    *
    * public class Main {
    *       public static void main(String args[]{
    *           System.out.println("Hello World");
    *       }
    * }
    *
    * but in REPL you can print "hello world" by simply typing in the
    * System.out.println("Hello World");
    * No import, no package, no class just above command(statement) and also without any semicolon
    *
    * Many many programming languages have REPL such as python, scala, swift, javascript and many others
    *
    * REPL supports the statements, expressions, declaration, interface, method declaration, field declaration, import declarations and external libraries
    *
    * REPL is used to writting and testing small code snippets, REPL is not a integrated development envnironment and they are not used to write programs of any significant size
    *
    * 1. check the 1jshell.png image in jshellJava9Introduction folder
    * 2. adding two numbers 2jshell.png
    * 3. to clear the shell hit {ctrl + L}
    * 4. int initialize with some number and multiple by 3 in 3shell.png
    * 5. check string example in 4shell.png
    * 6. by default import in jshell 5jshell.png
    * 7. create a list and sort then print in 6jshell.png
    * 8. SIZE OF LIST and contain in 7jshell.png
    * 9. math function in 8jshell.png
    * 10. initialize two variable of int and add it, making function of name sayHelloWorld, and show the list of history in 9jshell.png
    * 11. history of all with error statements as well in 10jshell.png
    * 12. shortcut keys of jshell in 11jshell.png
    * 13. creating class which name is AngularClass, create instance of this AngularClass, and call getSize method in 12jshell.png
    * 14. edit class use /edit command and name of the class, in 13jshell.png
    * 15. just edit size +1 then press on accept then create new instance and getsize in 14jshell.png
